Answer The Following Questions:

Visualization:
1. Do you expect logistic regression to perform well on generic_1? Why?
I expect logistic regression to perform well on generic_1.
The classes are almost linearly separable.
With some regularization to stabilize, the model should be extreme extremely confident
in its predictions, and the sigmoid should look almost like a step function.

2. Do you expect logistic regression to perform well on generic_2? Why?
I expect logistic regression to not perform well on generic_2.
The classes cannot be well separated by a linear plane, and therefore logistic regression
should not perform well.
It seems like any line/plane we draw will not decrease the entropy at all as the dataset looks
symmetric on its classes for any orientation.

3. Why canâ€™t we directly visualize the iris dataset? What are some ways to visualize it?
We can not directly visualize the iris dataset as a 2d scatter plot can not handle 4 dimensional inputs.
We can visualize the iris dataset by having a 3d scatterplot to handle 3 of the 4 features, then having the 4th
feature represented by the visual size of the data point.
then we can use the color of the datapoint to represent the class.

Analysis:
1. Generic datasets: Does logistic regression perform well on these datasets? Do the actual results agree with your initial hypotheses?
Yes, the actual results agree with my initial hypotheses
generic_1 performs well while generic_2 does not.

2. Iris dataset: Does logistic regression do well on this dataset? If not, does regularization help? 
Without regularization does very well with a test accuracy of 100%,
And it seems like regularization decreases the test accuracy.

3. What are the training and validation accuracies? Do they look reasonable? Explain.
the training accuracies are slightly less than 100% for iris and generic_1
this is expected as the training sets are not perfectly linearly separable,
so logistic regression cannot create a perfect split, and thus a 100% training accuracy.

the training accuracy for generic_2 is relatively low and that is expected as the dataset is very hard to separate lineally.

Bonus: If your initial hypothesis disagrees with the result on generic_1 dataset, can you explain why that is the case?
my initial hypothesis agreed with the result on the generic_1 dataset as it did perform well,
A possible explanation for if generic_1 performed poorly is if the data set is too small to correctly model the data and its features.
