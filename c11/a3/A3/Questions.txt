Answer The Following Questions:

Visualization:
1. Do you expect logistic regression to perform well on generic_1? Why?
#todo

2. Do you expect logistic regression to perform well on generic_2? Why?


3. Why canâ€™t we directly visualize the iris dataset? What are some ways to visualize it?
We can not directly visualize the iris dataset as a 2d scatter plot can not handle 4 dimensional inputs.
We can visualize the iris dataset by having a 3d scatterplot to handle 3 of the 4 input dimensions, then having the 4th
dimension represented by the size of the data point.
then we can use the color of the datapoint to represent the 1d output.


Analysis:
1. Generic datasets: Does logistic regression perform well on these datasets? Do the actual results agree with your initial hypotheses?


2. Iris dataset: Does logistic regression do well on this dataset? If not, does regularization help? 


3. What are the training and validation accuracies? Do they look reasonable? Explain.


Bonus: If your initial hypothesis disagrees with the result on generic_1 dataset, can you explain why that is the case?
