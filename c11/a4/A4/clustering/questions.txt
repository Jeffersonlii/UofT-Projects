%%  Step 0
%%%%%%%%%%

1) What is the average sparsity of input vectors? (in [0, 1])
On average, 9506 / 9635 * 100= 98.6% of the input vector is zero

2) Find the 10 most common terms, find the 10 least common terms.  (list, separated by commas)
most common:
[get, world, go, govern, first, time, game, on, peopl, year]

least common:
[chagrin, bse, angelina, revolt, Â£117m, culprit, blister, horizont, julio, chill]
3) What is the average frequency of non-zero vector entries in any document?
the average frequency is 1.4524

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 1
%%%%%%%%%%

1) Can you categorize the topic for each cluster? (list, comma separated)
#todo

2) What factors make clustering difficult?
#todo

3) Will we get better results with a lucky initial guess for cluster centers?
   (yes/no and a short explanation of why)
    Yes, the loss function is not strictly convex, its possible for there to be multiple local minimas,
    and a lucky guess might bring us to a lower local minima then an unlucky guess.

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 2
%%%%%%%%%%

1) What problem from step 1 is solved now?


2) What are the topics for clusters?


3) Is the result better or worse than step 1? (give a short explanation as well)


%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 3
%%%%%%%%%%

1) What are the topics for clusters?


2) Why is the clustering better now?


3) What is the general lesson you learned in clustering sparse, high-dimensional
   data?


%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 5
%%%%%%%%%%

1) What is the total error difference between K-Means++ and random center initialization?


2) What is the mean and variance of total errors after running K-Means++ 5 times?


3) Do the training errors appear to be more consistent?


4) Do the topics appear to be more meaningful?


%%%%%%%%%%
%%  K-Means vs GMM
%%%%%%%%%%

1) Under what scenarios do the methods find drastically different clusters? Why?


2) What happens to GMM as we increase the dimensionality of input feature? Does K-Means suffer from the same problem?
