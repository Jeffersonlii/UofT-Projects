1. Is a single DT prone to over-fitting with the occupancy dataset?
Yes, Compared to 100 decision trees, a single DT performed much worse.
On half the seeds, single DT had a test Accuracy of mid 80 percent,
while training with 100 DTs had a test accuracy of above 95% for all seeds.
This is indicative that training with a single DT is prone to over-fitting, and generalizes worse than using more trees.

2. How does classification accuracy behave as a function of the number of trees?
As we increase the number of trees, test accuracy tends to increase linearly

3. Do you think the random forest was helpful?  Explain.
Yes, random forest was helpful.
Random forest out performs in test accuracy on average.
Therefore Random forest generalizes better and filters out more noise
