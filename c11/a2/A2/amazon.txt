1. Can you reach a high accuracy on the test set using random forests? 
No, all variations of the hyperperamaters results in a test accuracy of less than 20%

2. Can you think of a better way to choose split functions as opposed to the method in _find_split?
Instead of univariate split functions, we could instead use multivariate split functions to better fit the data.
Although multivariate split functions would take much longer to train.

3. How does this challenge differ from that with the occupancy dataset?
occupancy dataset has ~6 times the training data of the amazon dataset.
The lack of training data makes the amazon much harder to train
