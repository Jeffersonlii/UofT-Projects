EM Line Fitting

Answer The Following Questions:
1. In test case 0, the two lines fit well. The ownership probabilities are either 0 or 1 near the right
   and left sides of the plot, but near 0.5 closer to the middle. Explain why this occurs and why it's useful.


2. In test case 1, the lines do not fit the data well.
   Explain what might be the source of the problem in this case.


3. Test cases 2 and 3 fit two and three lines, but in both cases not all lines appear to fit the 
   data well. Select one of these two test cases and explain what might be the source of the problem, 
   making reference to the model variance and the ownership probabilities.


Bonus: Set test_case = 4 and run train_em_line_fitting.py. This sets num_lines = 5 and sigma = 3.0. 
       What happens to the fit? With mixture models, it commonly happens that one sets the number of 
       model components too high for a given dataset. Explain how you might adjust the algorithm to 
       automatically find an appropriate number of lines?
