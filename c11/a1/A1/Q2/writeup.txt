For the following questions, please answer concisely in bullet points.

Q1: Dataset Size
- If I increase the size of the training set, what can we expect about the model's
  training error? What about the test error?
  - I can expect the training error to increase or stay relatively unchanged
  - I can expect the test error to decrease dramatically
- If I increase the size of the test set, what can we expect the about the model's
  training error? What about the test error?
  - I can expect my training error to remain unchanged
  - I can expect my test error to increase
- How much data should I try to obtain if I want to build a good model?
  - as much as possible

Q2: Model Complexity
- If the model is too simple, what can we conclude about the training and test errors?
  - both training and test errors are relatively high
  - for training data, the simplest model yields the highest error
  - test error is relatively high, but the error is much higher when the model gets too complex and ungeneralized
- If the model is too complex, what can we conclude about the training and test errors?
  - training error will decrease as the model will start to model the noise, but test error will increase drastically
- Which (degree) model gives the best performance? How did you find out?
  - Dataset 1
    - degree 3 gives the best performance, this is because degree 3 performs consistently well between the small and large dataset.
          In contrary, other degrees such as 3 performs slightly better on the large dataset but much worse on the small dataset
  - Dataset 2
    - degree 2 gives the best performance, this is because degree 2 has the best performance on the small dataset,
        while its performance on the large dataset is relatively equivalent to high degrees
  - Dataset 3
    - degree 5 gives the best performance, this is because degree 5 has far best the performance on the small dataset,
        while its performance on the large dataset is relatively equivalent or greater than other degrees

- What degree of polynomial do you think was used to generate the data?
  - Dataset 1
    - degree 3
  - Dataset 2
    - degree 2
  - Dataset 3
    - degree 5
    
Q3: Regularization
- What does regularization do to the weights? Note: You may want to look at the weight values.
  - regularization decreases weight values to promote smoothness of the model
- If we set lambda (l2_coef) to 0, what do we get?
  - we get the model without regularization
- What does increasing lambda (l2_coef) do to our loss function?
  - punishes unsmoothness more
  - generally decrease error
  - decrease the noise's effect on the model
