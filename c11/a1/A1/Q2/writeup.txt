For the following questions, please answer concisely in bullet points.

Q1: Dataset Size
- If I increase the size of the training set, what can we expect about the model's
  training error? What about the test error?
  - I can expect the training error to increase
  - I can expect the test error to decrease
  - I can expect the 2 errors to converge
- If I increase the size of the test set, what can we expect the about the model's
  training error? What about the test error?
  - I can expect my training error to remain relatively unchanged
  - I can expect my test error to increase
- How much data should I try to obtain if I want to build a good model?
  - as much as possible

Q2: Model Complexity
- If the model is too simple, what can we conclude about the training and test errors?
  - both training and test errors are relatively high
- If the model is too complex, what can we conclude about the training and test errors?
  - training error will decrease as the model will start to model the noise, but test error will increase drastically
- Which (degree) model gives the best performance? How did you find out?
  - degree 3 gives the best performance, I found out by comparing the error graphs, and recognizing that degree 3 consistently gives a good, if not best, performance
- What degree of polynomial do you think was used to generate the data?
  - degree 3 

Q3: Regularization
- What does regularization do to the weights? Note: You may want to look at the weight values.
  - regularization decreases weight values to promote smoothness of the model
- If we set lambda (l2_coef) to 0, what do we get?
  - we get the model without regularization
- What does increasing lambda (l2_coef) do to our loss function?
  - punishes unsmoothness more
  - generally decrease error
