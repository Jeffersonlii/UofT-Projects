 *                       CSCB63 Winter 2021
 *                  Assignment 1 - AVL Trees
 *                  (c) Mustafa Quraish, Jan. 2021
 *
 * This is the file which should be completed and submitted by you
 * for the assignment. Make sure you have read all the comments
 * and understood what exactly you are supposed to do before you
 * begin. A few test cases are provided in `testClosest.c`, which
 * can be run on the command line as follows:
 *
 *  $> gcc testClosest.c -o testClosest
 *  $> ./testClosest [optional testname]  (or .\testClosest.exe if on Windows)
 *
 * I strongly advise that you write more test cases yourself to see
 * if you have expected behaviour, especially on the edge cases for
 * insert(). You are free to make any reasonable design choices for
 * the implementation of the data structure as long as (1) the outputs
 * are consistent with the expected results, and (2) you meet the
 * complexity requirement. Your closestPair() function will only
 * be tested with cases where there are unique solutions.
 *
 * Mark Breakdown (out of 10):
 *  - 0 marks if the code does not pass at least 1 test case.
 *  - If the code passes at least one test case, then:
 *    - Up to 6 marks for successfully passing all the test cases
 *    - Up to 4 marks for meeting the complexity requirements for 
 *        the functions as described in the comments below.

/**
 * This function is supposed to insert a new node with the give value into the 
 * tree rooted at `root` (a valid AVL tree, or NULL)
 *
 *  NOTE: `value` is a positive integer in the range 1 - 1,000,000 (inclusive)
 *       The upper bound here only exists to potentially help make the 
 *                implementation of edge cases easier.
 *
 *  TODO:
 *  - Make a node with the value and insert it into the tree
 *  - Make sure the tree is balanced (AVL property is satisfied)
 *  - Return the *head* of the new tree (A balance might change this!)
 *  - Make sure the function runs in O(log(n)) time (n = number of nodes)
 * 
 * If the value is already in the tree, do nothing and just return the root. 
 * You do not need to print an error message.
 *
 * ----
 * 
 * An example call to this function is given below. Note how the
 * caller is responsible for updating the root of the tree:
 *
 *  AVLNod *root = (... some tree is initialized ...);
 *  root = insert(root, 5); // Update the root!

/**
 * This function returns the closest pair of points in the tree rooted
 * at `root`. You can assume there are at least 2 values already in the
 * tree. Since you cannot return multiple values in C, for this function
 * we will be using pointers to return the pair. In particular, you need
 * to set the values for the two closest points in the locations pointed
 * to by `a` and `b`. For example, if the closest pair of points is
 * `10` and `11`, your code should have something like this:
 *
 *   (*a) = 10 // This sets the value at the address `a` to 10
 *   (*b) = 11 // This sets the value at the address `b` to 11
 *
 * NOTE: Make sure `(*a)` stores the smaller of the two values, and
 *                 `(*b)` stores the greater of the two values.
 * 
 * NOTE: The test cases will have a unique solution, don't worry about 
 *        multiple closest pairs here.
 *
 *
 * TODO: Complete this function to return the correct closest pair.
 *       Your function should not be any slower than O(log(n)), but if 
 *       you are smart about it you can do it in constant time.
